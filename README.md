# Final_Project
 
This DevOps project aims to set up the infrastructure and application deployment for a web application using various tools and technologies. The key components include:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Using terraform to provision and ansible to configure the infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, and security groups.

Containerization: Using Docker to build and manage the application containers.

Container Orchestration: Using Kubernetes to deploy and manage the containerized application.

Continuous Integration and Deployment: Using Jenkins to set up a multi-branch pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the application.
